      <description>Monitoring: it appears that during the deploymnet the server was overloaded. Currently investigating how to bring it back to normal operation. https://gyazo.com/b0fe70c4e777002c9a87428ede03b58d Currently we are trying to shut down the virtual machine and deallocate it, since we can&amp;rsquo;t ssh into the server.
Investigating: bchan is currently down due to a deployment on the production server gone wrong. I will aim to restore services soon!
And happy halloween!</description>
